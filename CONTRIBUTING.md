## Branch strategy
In our developing, [git-flow model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) is applied. The master branch is a stable version, and develop branch is a early access version. The fork and pull-request is encouraged for develop (or feature) branch, not master branch.
